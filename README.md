# Duece

Duece is a simple and fun snake and ladders game for two players. The goal is to reach the 100th place on the board before your opponent does. The game is developed with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, and uses jQuery for some animation effects.

## Installation

- The first person will start first.
- On your turn, click on **Roll the Dice** button to roll a pair of dice. 
- Your coin will start moves according to the outcome encountered from the dice you rolled only after outcome **one** encountered.
- You are given with the another turn if the outcome of your dice is six or else your turn   will came to end and the opponent will play the game.
- You can roll the dice to move forward, but watch out for the snakes that will drag you down. You can also climb the ladders that will boost you up.
- The first player to reach 100 wins the game.

## Motivation

I built this project as a personal challenge to create a game with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript in a short period of time. As I completed a half of the Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp Course in Udemy, I challenged myself to build this game using the knowledge I gained from the Course. I also wanted to learn further on how to use jQuery for some animation effects. I learnt CSS animation on YouTube for doing this in addition to the Web Development Course.
